#Farm-Helper-App
# Inspiration-

My father is having a farm and my uncle is a farmer too. And like them, there are millions of farmers in India. I wanted to do something for them so I thought of making an app that can help farmers. Because many farmers end up their lives due to many problems. So, I want to build an app by which farmers can manage their farm properly. In the working prototype of my app, I have made a feature by which farmers can turn on and off their water pump remotely sitting at their home and it will trigger an IOT device that will turn on/off the motor. I would also like to add such feature by which farmers can schedule their week/month/year ahead so that they can benefit from their crop early, another feature that I would like to add that is to sell their produce directly to the retailer removing the middlemen and giving farmers higher profits.

## Real - World Problems

Farmers get fewer profits from their produce examples. farmers sales vegetables for 10₹/kg and is sold to customers for 80-100₹ we can reduce these difference by removing the middlemen and providing farmers a platform where they can sell their produce at the proper price

Farmers need to go to their farm frequently to turn the water pump on/off at odd hours due to irregular hours of electricity and not having proper roads and there is also a risk of wild animals at night in rural areas so that with my app and some IoT device at the farm farmers can control their water-pump at the farm at anytime

Farmers find it difficult to manage their crops in long term with my app they can have a diary and a timeline of their crop so that they can have their crops ready at time E.G. sometimes the price of a crop may be high in February -March example 100Rs/kg but would suddenly drop in April and May example 40-20Rs/kg so the farmers can get time advantage if they manage to get their crops ready early and can have a good profit

## My Solution

In my current prototype I have implemented a feature by which farmers can control their farm water-pump remotely through my app and an IOT device would we be placed at farm which would turn on/off the motor.

### Instructions for my app

1. At first you will see a menu it has all the feature that I want to implement but  top-most motor-controller is working **you can click on the motor controller button.**
2. Now you will see a text-input where you can write id of the motor you want to control ,*this will write to database with that id name will be stored and can be used by IOT device*
3. now **press open motor controller** an will see the controller where you can see the motor status and turn it on/off 

**It works proper when on smartphone (Press Ctrl +Shift +M)**
